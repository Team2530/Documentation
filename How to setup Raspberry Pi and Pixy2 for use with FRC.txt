Setting up the software for the Raspberry Pi is very straight forward. Instructions on how to do that can be found [here](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/85074/l/1027241-using-the-raspberry-pi-for-frc). Setting up the Pixy2 is as little more complicated. Instructions for installing pixymon on linux can be found [here](http://www.cmucam.org/projects/cmucam5/wiki/Installing_PixyMon_on_Linux). For MacOS X [here](https://docs.pixycam.com/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:v2:install_pixymon_on_mac), and for Windows click [here](https://github.com/charmedlabs/pixy2/raw/master/releases/pixymon_windows/pixymon_v2_windows-3.0.24.exe). This is a download link however. Just run the exe and you should be up and running in now time.
