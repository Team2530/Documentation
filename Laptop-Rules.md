### LAPTOP CONDUCT

Common sense. That's about it.

- Don't steal someone else's laptop. (They'll have masking tape with their name on theirs if they've claimed one.)
- Don't install programs that aren't needed. They take up space on the laptops and will have to be uninstalled later, taking up precious team time. If you really need it, use the web version (Spotify, Discord, etc.)
- These are not "your" laptops. They are team laptops. Some personalization is okay, but don't overhaul the device.
- When installing programs, check with a coach or at least a programming lead to make sure it's okay.
- Don't mess with the laptop. No pulling out keys, no stealing the plastic SD card slot fillers, no scratching at the plastic coating to make it look weird. Don't commit stupid.
