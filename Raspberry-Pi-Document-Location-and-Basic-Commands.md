# Raspberry pi document location and basic commands
Everything about running the program is already completed when the pi boots. The ```linefollow.py``` program is set to run upon boot. To edit the program, go to the ```python_demos``` folder, which is where the program is stored, by typing ```cd Documents/pixy2/python_demos``` and then open the ```linefollow.py``` program in nano by typing ```sudo nano linefollow.py``` after going to the ```Documents``` folder. That's it! the Pi should take care of the rest.
