Title: `.gitignore` doesn't work

This happens when the files you're trying to ignore have already been committed in the repository.

# How to fix

1. Remove the directories and files you want to be ignored. If some of these aren't autogenerated (you want to keep them), just move them somewhere else temporarily.
2. Create and push a commit to the affected branch of the repository.
3. For any directories or files that you chose to keep, move them back to their original locations.
