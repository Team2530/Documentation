0. Make contact with Superior to discuss lead time for shirts.
1. Decide overall design/graphic layout for each item (i.e. where the logos and printed elements are such as front/back/sleeve), including how many printed colors are in the design. All these things affect the cost. (The more colors and the more locations, the greater the cost). Please see the "2023 Merchandise Details" document in the post [above](https://discord.com/channels/658767612200615939/1184319920666837022/1192867156744994889) for what I mean)  WHO:  In past years this was 1 BzNz student, myself and Steve. This year I am not sure which individuals identify as taking part in this. Please feel free to identify yourselves. I recommend we meet soon this week at one of our meetings to discuss.
2. Update any graphics in the design elements (i.e. sponsor layout, changes to the logo or wording, for instance we added the word "Robotics" under our Inconceivable logo last year.) WHO- graphics team.
3. Decide which apparel style & brand we are using (e.g. Gildan 50/50 poly Short Sleeve tee, Sport tek Unisex zip up etc etc). WHO- This step has already been done by me for this year.
4. Email mock up designs / design descriptions to Superior Screening so they can give us a price quotefor each item type (hoodie, sport zip, tshirt SS, tshirt LS). WHO- I will do this once I have any info from step #1
5. Solicit orders from team members via google survey (I suggest ideally this be done by Jan 16 or 17)   WHO- BzNZ team member
6. Collate orders and email order to Superior by Jan 26 at latest - WHO- BzNz team member and myself
7. Immediately with the order, Send any NEW graphic files to Superior. Any that are unchanged they likely have on file.  WHO- graphics team member can email directly or email via me.
8. Add up the cost of each person's order and collect money from them.
9. Pick up shirts at Superior and distribute to the team by March 1
