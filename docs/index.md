# Welcome to Team 2530's Documentation website

!!! tip "This documentation is a living document."

    This means that no page is ever finished. Feel free to update **any** documentation page if you feel there is something that needs to be added to it.


The Documentation is divided into three types of pages: Wiki Pages, Guides, and Indices. 

## Wiki Pages

Wiki Pages are like encyclopedia or wikipedia articles about a specific topic. They don't include instructional information, but merely explain *what something is*.

## Guides

Guides are instructional, step-by-step guides on how to achieve a given result. They might also have a link to a youtube video made by our team on the topic.

## Indices

Indices (or Index Pages) are giant lists of pages (Wiki Pages, Guides, and perhaps even other Indices) that are related to a specific topic or training program.
