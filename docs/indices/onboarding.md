    Mentor onboarding isn't documented here yet.


This is a list of things that new students will need access to in order to participate on the team.

    We use the team calendar for scheduling of meetings and other team events. You can add it to your own Google Calendar or access it from [our website](https://frcteam2530.org/#schedule).

3. Google Drive

    The team Google Drive is essential. To get access to it, talk with a Coach.

4. Interest-specific items

    If you are interested in Programming, CAD, Mechanical, Electronics, Business, Graphics or another subteam, there are other programs and services that you will need access to. Find out who the subteam lead is and then ask them about it.
