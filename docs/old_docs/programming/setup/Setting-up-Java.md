# (Deprecated) Setting up Java

### THIS ARTICLE IS DEPRECATED. You no longer need to manually install Java, as it is bundled with the [WPILib VSCode installation](https://github.com/Team2530/Documentation/wiki/Setting-up-VSCode).

***

This one has a couple steps to it, you need both the JRE and JDK to program.

#### Note: one consideration you have to make is that all laptops are running that same version of Java; this way we can rule out mismatched versions of Java for causing problems with code.

Since it would be troublesome to update the links all the time, just look up the download pages for the Java 8 JRE and JDK.

Once both are installed, you should be good.
