# Setting up the PixyCam2

The PixyCam2 (or just Pixy) is a camera with built-in object recognition.

## Installing Pixymon
The software that configures this object recognition (Pixymon) needs to be downloaded to a computer. The download page is [here](https://pixycam.com/downloads-pixy2/) -- if that doesn't work, just do a web search for Pixymon and it'll probably be the first page.

Further instructions can be found in the "installation docs" underneath the download links on the page above.

## Installing libraries
Follow the instructions here: https://github.com/PseudoResonance/Pixy2JavaAPI#readme

## Configuring hardware
If you're using the Pixy with a Raspberry Pi, follow [these instructions](https://team2530.github.io/Documentation/programming/setup/Setting-up-the-PixyCam2/).
