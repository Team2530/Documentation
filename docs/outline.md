## Instructional pages

specific and detailed how-to pages

### Programming Instructional pages

- getting started with the ROMI
- the basics of Java Syntax
- how to manage github repositories
- how to create a new robot code repository
- how to create autos with pathplanner
- how to create commands with WPILib's command-based architecture
- how to install all required software on a team laptop
- how to update the roborio
- how to make changes to the team website - both the process of getting things approved and the technical side of things

### CAD and General Design Instructional pages

- how to create a frame in CAD
- how to design a climber
- how to design a shooter or wheeled intake
- how to make an arm in CAD
- how to create drawings for machining
- how to use featurescripts

### Electronics Instructional pages

- how to wire an entire robot
- how to graph battery voltages and determine which batteries are the best
- how to crimp every type of connector (with photos)
- how to solder connections (but make sure to put a warning saying that crimping should be considered first)

### Machining and CAM Instructional pages

- how to use each of the machines in the shop
- how to 3D print
- how to build quick prototypes during kickoff

## Index pages

These should be ordered lists of pages that include things people should know. There can be an index of things for general onboarding along with an index for each subteam's onboarding process and information that new students need to know.

### CAD Index pages

- an index of all keyboard shortcuts that our team knows about - each should have a link to a wiki page

### Electronics Index pages

- an index of tips and tricks for keeping the electronics safe and reliable

## Other notes

- It would be very nice if the documentation website could support dynamic wikilinks to any of the pages.
