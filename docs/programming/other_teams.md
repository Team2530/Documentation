# Resources from other teams

## Programming Essentials

### Java Basics

### Git and Version Control

## Concepts of Robots and Programming

### Hardware

pneumatics, motors / encoders

how these work:
arm, shooter, led's, swerve drive, motors, intake

### Ideas

subsystems and commands
PID
feedforward
odometry
sysid
vision processing

## FRC-specific Implementation

### Development environment

This section has links for setting up a development environment and installing FRC software from wpilib. 

A windows machine is required for some tools.
