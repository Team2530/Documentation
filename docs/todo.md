# Documentation TODO List

- Add remaining onshape features
- Create an updated guide for updating documentation
- Create some kind of "kitchen sink" page that has examples of all the different formatting options, with source code included.
- Consider adding a "recently updated pages" page
- Think of ways that documentation can become a part of the team's goal for a given season
    - How can documentation updates be quantified in a way that accurately indicates how much we are using the documentation?
