    If you are a team member and know more about this topic than what is currently here please contribute that information.

The book of knowledge was a project done by Team 2530 members in 2017 in order to document what they knew. In some ways it is the origin of this documentation.

While many things in FRC have changed since they were written, it is incredibly valuable to look through the book of knowledge in order to see what past students have done.

## Why was it written?

> "The original intent of the Book of Knowledge was to create a wealth of information for all of our team members. During year-to-year transitions, we found that many of our graduating students were leaving the team without passing their knowledge on. Instead of simply coaching younger team members, we wanted to create a more tactile and flexible place for information. And thus, the Book of Knowledge was born."
