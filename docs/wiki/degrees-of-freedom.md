Degrees of freedom (DOF) refers to the number of quantites that can vary independantly.

For example, a point on a plane has 2 degrees of freedom as the X and Y components of its position are independant.

This term is most commonly used in [[FRC]] when discussing arms, manipulators and other scoring devices.
