# Google Drive

Google Drive is a file storage solution that our team uses for many applications.

## Layout of Google Drive

The top level of the Google Drive is seperated into folders for each [[FRC]] season in addition to folders for projects that aren't tied to a specific season such as the team's sponsors, finances and battery testing.

In the folder for a given season you will find the game manual and folders for subteams/events/agendas.

## Access Control

!!! tip "Don't use a school account"

    Make sure that you don't use your school email when being added to the Google Drive. Documents created within [[RPS]] cannot be viewed by Google accounts that are not also within [[RPS]].
