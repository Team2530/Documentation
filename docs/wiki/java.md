# Java

!!! tip "Java is not Javascript"
    The names are similar, but Java is not the same thing as Javascript. Javascript (JS) is the programming language used in websites to provide dynamic logic, while Java is used for our robot code.

Java is a general-purpose, [[Object Oriented]], bytecode-based programming language that was developed.

Java code requires something called a [[JVM]] to run. [[JVM]] stands for Java Virtual Machine, and it acts as a machine that understands Java Bytecode (stored in `.class` files) and does nothing but run that bytecode. To create that bytecode, you need a Java compiler (called `javac`) that translates the human-readable Java source files (`.java` files) into Java bytecode files (`.class` files).
