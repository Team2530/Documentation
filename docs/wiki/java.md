# Java

!!! tip "Java is not Javascript"
    The names are similar, but Java is not the same thing as Javascript. Javascript (JS) is the programming language used in websites to provide dynamic logic, while Java is used for our robot code.

## What is Java?

Java is a general-purpose, [Object Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [bytecode-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode) programming language.

We use Java to develop all of our robot code.

Java code requires something called a [[JVM]] to run. [[JVM]] stands for Java Virtual Machine, and it acts as a machine that understands Java Bytecode (stored in `.class` files) and does nothing but run that bytecode. To create that bytecode, you need a Java compiler (called `javac`) that translates the human-readable Java source files (`.java` files) into Java bytecode files (`.class` files).

## How can I learn Java?

Here are some links to tutorials on basic Java:

| Tutorial | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) | W3Schools teaches the basics of Java Syntax |
| [FRCDocs: Getting Started](https://frcdocs.wpi.edu/en/2020/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/index.html) | Explains the basics of programming robots. |
| [Team 3255 "Create a basic driving robot"](https://frcteam3255.github.io/FRC-Java-Tutorial/programming/driving_robot.html) | Another team wrote this article about how to program a basic robot that drives. This will be hard to follow along with since you don't have any of the hardware, but can still be valuable to read. |
