# Neo 550

![](../assets/images/neo-550.png)

> The NEO 550 Brushless Motor is a member in the NEO family of brushless motors. Its output power and small size are specifically designed to make NEO 550 the perfect motor for intakes and other non-drivetrain robot mechanisms. Mounting holes and pilot match a standard 550 series motor, making it natively mount to many existing off-the-shelf gearboxes.
