# The Shrieking Eel

The Shrieking Eel was our robot for the 2024-25 season [[Reefscape]].

## Design

### Frame and Drivetrain

The Eel is a [[Swerve Drive]] robot. We used Mk4I modules with an L2 gearing in order to accelerate quickly for short cycles. The motors are [[Kraken x60]]s, and it is steered by [[NEO 1.1]]s. We 3D-printed wheel well guards to protect the drive train from dirt and debris.

The frame perimeter is 29.5"x29.5". This provides a large wheelbase for stability. The baseplate is low, and this prevents bumps on the field and lowers the risk of high-centering[^1] on algae gamepieces. The rails on the frame are made of [[80/20 #1020]], with aluminum blocks to lower the [[Center of Gravity|CG]]. The baseplate of the frame is made of 3mm polycarbonate instead of HDPE for weight reasons, inspectability and frame rigidity. [[Eye bolts]] were added in the drop blocks to add carrying straps.

[^1]: [High-centering](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/high-center) means to "become stranded with all wheels off the ground" according to Wiktionary.

### Bumpers

This year's game manual introduced changes to bumper requirements, and we went through a lengthy design process to make them more sophisticated than ever.

Each set of bumpers (4 pieces in total, 2 red and 2 blue) takes the form of two U-shaped halves that form a rectangle.

!!! warning "Not finished"

    This section is a work in progress. An exploded view would be very nice.

Backer components are made of oak plywood, and have a height of 5in and a thickness of 0.7 inches.

The foam has two layers instead of three for shock reduction and simplicity. The inner layer is made of 2‚Äù Polyethylene (PE) Foam 1.7#/cuft from Foam Factory, <Foambymail.com>. The outer layer is made of 1" EVA Floor tiles (self measured density 4.3#/cuft:  Prosource Extra Thick EVA Foam Interlocking Tiles (Amazon)).

The red/blue cloth covers on the bumpers are made of Seattle Fabrics' 1000D Cordura Nylon. The numbers "2530" were printed as vinyl stickers. Comic sans was chosen as a font after a short survey.

These components were used for the brackets and mounts:
- Corner Brackets:  2 inch Aluminum L channel 2-inch bracket
- Plummer Industries Vertical Mounts for frame attachment
- Through bolt X 2 through the 80/20 frame on each long side of U bumper for stabilization
